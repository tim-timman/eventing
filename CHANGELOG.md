## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Module level `eventing.set_event_loop(...)` setting the event loop on root,
  top of the hierarchy, making any emitter capable of handling coroutine
  function listeners.

### Changed
- `ee.emit(...)` will now look for an event loop up the hierarchy on emit when
  a coroutine listener is encountered. If `a.b.c` emits an event with coroutine
  function listener it will first check if itself has a loop, then `a.b`, `a`
  and finally the root event emitter. If one isn't found it raises
  `NoEventLoopError`.

## [0.2.0] - 2022-06-03
### Added
- Support coroutine functions (`async def`) as listeners. Threadsafe. The event
  loop to use has to be set before a coroutine function listener is emitted, eg.
  `ee.set_event_loop(asyncio.get_running_loop())`.
- Support listeners that emit events (including the one it's listening
  to) without potential for `RecursionError`.
- Support listeners removing themselves.
- Coverage report
- Decorator `@ee.on(...)` to add a listener for an event.
