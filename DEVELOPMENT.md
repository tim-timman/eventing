# Development and Publishing

## Environment Setup

Create a local virtualenv at the root of the repo:
```
python3.10 -m venv --upgrade-deps venv
```
This will create a virtualenv at `venv/`


Activate the virtualenv:
```
source venv/bin/activate
```
> **Note:** from now on all commands are assumed to be run
> within the activated virtualenv.

This project uses [Flit][flit] as its Python packaging tool.
Install it using:
```
pip install flit
```
[flit]: https://flit.pypa.io/en/latest/

Install all dependencies for local development, and the package
itself as a symlink:
```
flit install -s --extras=all
```

Install the [pre-commit hook](#pre-commit-hook):
```
pre-commit install
```

### pre-commit hook
[pre-commit][pre-commit] used as a git pre-commit hook. It runs several checks
and tests to verify that the commit adheres to the code style for consistency
and make sure tests are passing.

[pre-commit]: https://pre-commit.com/

Aside from running on git's pre-commit hook, it can be manually run on the
current working tree. It will run against staged files, only applying any
modifications if there are no unstaged ones.
```
pre-commit run
```

## Local testing
These are all run as part of pre-commit on commit (except for tox; too slow)
but can also be run manually against the dirty working tree.

### pytest
Tests are written using [pytest][pytest] with the
[pytest-asyncio][pytest-asyncio] plugin to allow testing coroutines.

[pytest]: https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/contents.html
[pytest-asyncio]: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-asyncio

```
pytest
```

### flake8
Run codestyle, and docstring checks manually.
```
flake8
```

### mypy
Run mypy statical typechecking over the code manually.
```
mypy ./
```

### tox
Run the above [local testing](#local-testing) checks against the built package
in isolated environments across supported python versions.
```
tox
```

## Docs
Documentation are aimed to be generated from Google style docstrings in the
package using [sphinx][sphinx]. And also to later autogenerated and published
on [Read the Docs][rtd]. However, until we have an established public API
(`>=1.0.0`), this remains of less concern as the API is still being
established.

[sphinx]: https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/
[rtd]: https://readthedocs.org/

### Building docs
Build the docs from Google style docstrings in the package.
```
tox -e docs
```

### Serving docs
Serve the built docs at <http://[::1]:8000> using python's
[http.server][http.server] module. Automatically attempt to open your web
browser at that URI using python's [webbrowser][webbrowser] module. Use
`Ctrl-C` to kill the webserver.
```
tox -e serve-docs
```

[http.server]: https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html
[webbrowser]: https://docs.python.org/3/library/webbrowser.html

## Publishing

Building and publishing of the package to [PyPI][pypi] is handled
using [Flit][flit]. The project should adhere to [Semantic Versioning][semver]
and all that entails.

[pypi]: https://pypi.org/
[flit]: https://flit.pypa.io/en/latest/
[semver]: https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html

### Code check
Flit does not allow publishing in a dirty working tree (i.e. not everything is
committed). If committed, pre-commit should've verified the code integrity for
the local version and _should_ be enough to not release anything broken.
However, testing all supported python versions by running `tox` is a good idea.
Finally, above tests are only run on the developers OS. Automated tests across
OS' are run on GitHub as a GitHub Action; for best peace of mind, make sure
those are successful as well.

### Update the Changelog
Update the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) to detail changes in the new version.

### Update the Version
Update the package version in the code as given by [\_\_version\_\_][version].
This attribute is automatically used by Flit when building the package.

[version]: src/eventing/__init__.py#L9

### Build the package
Make sure the package builds using Flit:
```
flit build
```

### Add a Git Tag
Versions are tagged using annotated git tags:
```
git tag -a <version> -m ''
```

Make sure to push the tag with:
```
git push --follow-tags
```

### Publish the package to PyPI
Publish the package to PyPI using Flit:
```
flit publish
```

Flit checks for credentials to publish looking for `~/.pypirc` with the `[pypi]`
label. See [Flit Upload docs][flit-upload-docs].
