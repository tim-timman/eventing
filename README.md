A pythonic event emitter inspired by Node.js' [EventEmitter][njs-ee]
and Python's [logging][pylogging] libraries.

### Rationale
This project sprung to life partly from wanting to learn TDD and publishing a
python package, but also from the need of an event pattern akin to Node.js'
EventEmitter that will with asyncio in a nice pythonic way.

I envision it in a similar API as Python's logging module, in that it'll
"just work" regardless of event loops, threads (and possibly even subprocesses);
something I haven't found in the myriad event packages on PyPI. Hopefully, it'll
become something of use to others as well.

> **Note:** Until a version `>=1.0.0` these are not maintained as a public API
